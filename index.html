            ><br />
            A mechanical lift system designed for buildings with space constraints
            to carry weights up to 20kg across multiple floors. Features include:
            3D-modeled structure using SolidWorks with maximum area requirement of
            135 in², remote operation via Blynk IoT and Sinric Pro, solar-powered
            with closed-loop Battery Management System, and a movable joint with 2
            DOF (±90°). The device assists elderly people, individuals with motor
            impairments, and delivery agents. Patent published on Indian Patent
            Office website.

            <i>Research Paper Under Review | Clinical Trials in Progress</i><br />
            Edge computing-based system using Raspberry Pi, ESP-32 CAM, OpenCV,
            MediaPipe, and Machine Learning to enable people with motor impairments
            to control their environment through hand gestures. Designed
            specifically for users with limited hand motions and finger angles.
            Research paper drafted in LaTeX covering caregiver stress reduction and
            benefits of autonomous edge-based systems. Clinical trials planned in
            controlled and hospital environments under guidance of Dr. RS Saxena
            (Scientist G, SSPL, DRDO) at Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital.

            <i>Under Dr. Raghvendra Sahai Saxena (Scientist 'F')</i><br />
            Automated the analysis and extraction of device parameters of
            Metal-Oxide Semiconductor capacitors (MOSCAPs) including fixed charge
            density, oxide capacitance, rise time, and capacitor characteristics
            across high- and low-frequency C–V relations. Studied original research
            by William Shockley and John Bardeen, derived relations between
            capacitance and voltage of MOS devices, and developed optimized C
            program (migrated to Origin C) for automated analysis. Gained exposure
            to semiconductor fabrication facilities and cleanrooms. Received Letter
            of Recommendation for exceptional results.
